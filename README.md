# Customer Lifetime Value Prediction

## Project Overview
This project predicts the **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** for a business using historical customer interaction data. CLV helps estimate how much revenue a customer will generate over their entire relationship with the business.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:
- CustomerID: Unique customer identifier
- Recency: Days since last purchase
- Frequency: Number of purchases
- MonetaryValue: Total amount spent
- Tenure: Length of customer relationship (months)
- CLV: Target variable representing customer lifetime value

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
jupyter notebook clv_prediction.ipynb

3. Follow the notebook to:
- Load and explore data
- Visualize feature relationships
- Train a regression model
- Evaluate model performance
- Save the trained model
